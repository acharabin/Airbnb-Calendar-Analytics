# Airbnb-Calendar-Analytics

Product analytics hackathon using an Inside Airbnb calendar and listing dataset:

Please answer the following questions with Python:
1. Please review the integrity of the data. Do you notice any data anomalies? If so, please
describe them.
2. Calculate the average listing price by calendar day. Based on the results, do you notice
any performance trends of listing price over time? If so, please describe them and give
short explanations on why you think this could happen?
3. Suppose Airbnb charges 10% commission fee on each booked listing. Please use the
data to give business operation recommendations on how to increase the commission
revenue.
